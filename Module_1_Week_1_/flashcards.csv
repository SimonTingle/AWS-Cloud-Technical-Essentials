What problem does the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) primarily solve?,"It solves the problem of creating and managing complex cloud architectures, which is difficult and error-prone to do manually in the AWS console."

Why is it considered a security risk to use `aws configure` with long-lived access keys on a server or EC2 instance?,"The keys are stored in a plain text file on the machine, and anyone with access to the server could potentially gain access to your AWS account."
"What is the recommended security best practice for granting AWS permissions to services like EC2 instances, instead of using stored access keys?",Using IAM Roles.
"How can you get detailed documentation and a list of available commands for a specific AWS service in the CLI, for example, for S3?","By appending 'help' to the command, such as `aws s3 help`."
What popular command-line JSON processor is often recommended for use with the AWS CLI to filter and format its JSON output?,jq
Which AWS CLI S3 command is used to list all of your S3 buckets?,aws s3 ls
"To create a new S3 bucket from the AWS CLI, you would use the command `aws s3 _____`.",mb
What is the correct syntax for the path argument when referring to an S3 bucket or object in the AWS CLI?,"It must be an S3 URI, which starts with `s3://`, for example, `s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt`."
The AWS CLI command `aws s3 cp <source> <destination>` is used for what purpose?,"To copy a local file to S3, an S3 object to a local file, or an S3 object from one location to another."
"Which command is used to efficiently synchronize the contents of a local directory with an S3 bucket, only transferring new or modified files?",aws s3 sync
The AWS CLI command `aws s3 rb s3://<bucket-name>` performs what action?,It removes (deletes) an S3 bucket.
Which AWS CLI command lists all IAM users in your account?,aws iam list-users
"To create a new IAM user named 'newuser' from the CLI, you would run `aws iam _____ --user-name newuser`.",create-user
What command would you use to list information about your EC2 instances?,aws ec2 describe-instances
"To stop an EC2 instance with a specific ID from the CLI, you would use the command `aws ec2 _____ --instance-ids <id>`.",stop-instances
"To terminate (permanently delete) an EC2 instance from the CLI, you would use the command `aws ec2 _____ --instance-ids <id>`.",terminate-instances
"In AWS CLI `s3` commands, what do the `--exclude` and `--include` parameters allow you to do?",They allow you to perform pattern matching to either exclude or include specific files or objects from an operation.
"When using multiple `--exclude` and `--include` filters in an AWS CLI command, which filter takes precedence?",The filter that appears later in the command takes precedence.
